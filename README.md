# master-thesis
This project contains the numerical implementations of my Master's thesis. It features models of neural networks using chemical reaction networks, including training with a ReLU activation function, constructing the corresponding CRNs, and simulating their behavior. 

These implementations are presented in Chapter 6 of my thesis: 
- CRN-ODEs.ipynb corresponds to Section 6.3 and builds on the approach developed in Chapter 4.
- CRN-translation.ipynb is presented in Section 6.4 and builds upon the framework introduced in Chapter 5.
